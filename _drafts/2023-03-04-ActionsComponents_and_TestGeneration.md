Complex engineering endevors require complex calculations. It's open to 
debate as to when the first engineering project that 
required complex calculations occurred, but we know that the calculations
would have needed to be done by hand. And this state largely remained
until the broad availability of the electronic calculator in the 
1950s and 1960s.

But this doesn't mean that "computers" (those individuals performing
computations with pen and ink) were left to compute everything from the
ground up. Fortunately, books were published containing mathematical 
tables that provided pre-computed results of standard trigonometric 
functions for various input values. The data in these books of 
mathematical tables would, of course, have been produced
laboriously by some other "computer" or "computers" working with pen 
and paper. But, they were invaluable at increasing the speed with 
which complex calculations could be done by hand.

What does this have to do with Portable Test and Stimulus (PSS)? 
PSS is specifically designed to enable PSS processing tools to 
pre-compute the result complex test scenario relationships in order
to make the best use of instructions running at a few Hertz on a simulated 
RTL model of a processor. But, before we get to how PSS creates tests, 
we need to learn about two fundamental PSS concepts: Actions and Components

## Actions

## Components

## Test Creation Flow
