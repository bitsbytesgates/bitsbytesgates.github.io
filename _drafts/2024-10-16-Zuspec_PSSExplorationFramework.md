In the last post, I wrote about the three areas that I was watching around
PSS
- **Growing, Evolving Language** -- I want to see the language grow and improve
- **Growing Ecosystem** -- I want to see more people learn PSS, use PSS, and share some of what they've created
- **New PSS Applications** -- I want to see the exploration and emergence of new ways to use PSS

Clearly, much of the work of evolving the language will happen in the 
context of the Accellera PSS working group (PSWG). But, what about the
other areas? How can we accelerate people (engineers, students, hobbyists, etc)
learning about PSS? And, how can we accelerate experimentation and 
exploration of new potential applications of PSS?

# What role can Open Source Software Play?

If you've been reading this blog for any length of time, you likely 
know I'm very pro-open-source software. I've had the good fortune
to spend much of my career in a world where the combination of
open-source software authors and broad connectivity via the
internet resulted in an explosion of available open-source
software for nearly any purpose.
