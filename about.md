title: About
---

I'm Matthew Ballance, the Portland, Oregon-based author of the Bits, Bytes, Gates
blog. 

I have a deep interest in functional verification methodologies and techniques, 
especially where they involve both hardware and software or firmware. I'm very
interested in finding ways for open source software and techniques to contribute
to a vibrant ecosystem, and contribute to several open source projects in this domain.
Professionally, I work as a verification methodolgy and automation engineer at AMD. 
Over the previous 20 years in the EDA industry, I've worked in product development,
marketing, and management roles in the areas of hardware/software co-verification,
transaction-level modeling, IP encapsulation and reuse, and Portable Test and Stimulus.

All views expressed here are mine.
